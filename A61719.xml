            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>May it pleaſe Your Majeſty,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT hath been my greateſt Grief in all theſe Troubles, to be taken as a Perſon which ſhould endeavour to repreſent and ſet things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs between your Majeſty and your People; and to give Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels tending to the Diſquiet of your Three Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>Moſt true it is, that this mine own private Condition conſidered, it had been a great madneſs, ſince through your Gracious Favour I was ſo provided, as not to expect in any kind to mind my For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, or pleaſe my mind more, than by reſting where your Bounteous Hand had placed me.</p>
            <p>Nay, it is moſt mightily miſtaken; For unto your Majeſty it is well known, my poor and humble Advices concluded ſtill in this, That Your Majeſty and Your People could never be happy till there were a right Underſtanding betwixt you and them; no other means to effect and ſettle this Happineſs but by the Council, and Aſſent of the Parliament, or to prevent the Growing Evils upon this State, but by intirely putting your ſelf in your laſt Reſort upon the Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty and Good Affections of your <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subjects.</p>
            <p>Yet ſuch is my Misfortune, this Truth findeth little Credit, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſeemeth generally to be believed, and my ſelf reputed as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of ſeparation between you and your People, under a heavier Cenſure than which, I am perſwaded, no Gentleman can ſuffer.</p>
            <p>Now, I underſtand the Minds of Men are more incenſed againſt me, notwithſtanding Your Majeſty hath declared, that in your Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Opinion I am not guilty of Treaſon, nor are you ſatisfied in your Conſcience to paſs the Bill.</p>
            <p>This bringeth me into a very great ſtrait; there is before me the Ruin of my Children and Family, hitherto untouched in all the Branches of it with any foul Crimes. Here is before me the many Ills which may befall Your Sacred Perſon and the whole Kingdom, ſhould your
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51254:2" rendition="simple:additions"/> Self and the Parliament Part leſs ſatisfied one with the other than is neceſſary for the Preſervation of King and People. Here are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me the things moſt valued, moſt feared by Mortal Men, Life or Death.</p>
            <p>To ſay Sir, that there hath not been a Strife in me, were to make me leſs than God knoweth mine Infirmities give me.</p>
            <p>And to call Deſtruction upon my ſelf and young Children, were the Intentions of my Heart (at leaſt have been innocent of this great Offence) may be believed will find no eaſie Content to Fleſh and Blood.</p>
            <p>But with much Sadneſs I am come to a Reſolution of that which I take to be the beſt becoming me, to look upon that which is moſt principal in it ſelf, which doubtleſs is the Proſperity of your Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Perſon and the Commonwealth, infinitely before any mans pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Intereſt.</p>
            <p>And therefore in few words, as I put my ſelf wholly upon the Honour and Juſtice of my <hi>Peers</hi> ſo clearly, as to beſeech your Majeſty might pleaſe to have ſpared that Declaration of yours on <hi>Saturday</hi> laſt, and intirely to have left me to their Lordſhips: ſo now to ſet your Majeſties Conſcience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at liberty, I do moſt humbly beſeech you, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting of ſuch Miſchief as may happen by your Refuſal to paſs the Bill, by this means to remove (praiſed be God) I cannot ſay this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed but (I confeſs) this unfortunate thing forth of the way, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward that Bleſſed Agreement, which God, I truſt, ſhall for ever eſtabliſh betwixt you and your Subjects.</p>
            <p>Sir, my Conſent herein, ſhall more acquit you to God, than all the World can do beſides; to a willing mind there is no injury done, and as by God's Grace I forgive all the World, ſo Sir, I can give up the life of this World with all Chearfulneſs imaginable, in the juſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of your exceeding Favour, and only beg that in your Goodneſs, you would vouchſafe to caſt your Gracious Regard upon my poor Son and his Siſters, leſs or more, and no otherwiſe than their unfortunate Father ſhall appear more or leſs guilty of his Death. <hi>God long Preſerve Your Majeſty.</hi>
